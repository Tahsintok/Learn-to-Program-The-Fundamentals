## Problem Domain
A problem domain is an area of expertise that needs to be understood in order to solve a problem. When programmers are hired, they usually need to learn about their customer's problem domain. For example, if a programmer is hired by a non-profit organization to help with their financial database, that programmer might have to learn how taxes apply to non-profit organizations.

Every assignment in this course will have a problem domain that you will need to learn about.

## What to Do

There are several functions that you will need to implement. We have listed the functions roughly in order of complexity. Each function body will be quite short. You can submit your assignment for feedback once every hour up until the deadline; we recommend that you do this at least once early on in order to make sure you can submit properly.

## Fun stuff: a Graphical User Interface!

This will not work correctly until you have finished the rest of the assignment!

We provide a graphical user interface (GUI) that shows four clocks and allows you to choose time zones to display. Download this file and save it in the same directory as your a1.py file

Open a1_gui.py in IDLE, select \verb|Run -> Run Module|Run -> Run Module, and see the clocks in action!
You are not expected to understand the code in a1_gui.py.
(a1_gui.py wasn't written by me)
